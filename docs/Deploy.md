# 5. How to deploy locally

Rely on your current application’s
deployment procedure.

The module should be included and configured
within your application’s code.

Generally, you will start your application like this:

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn link @kalisio/feathers-keycloak-listener
$ yarn dev
```
